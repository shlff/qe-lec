# 1.1 about Python

**TBC=To Be Checked**

**PI=Potential improvement**


# 1 Overview

In this lecture(**PI: ,**) 3 things to do:

1. Outline what Python is
2. Show some of its abilities
3. compare it to some other languages

Note that we should not try to replicate **all** we see at this stage. We should know what Python is and what it can do.


# 2 Python
Python is free and open(**PI: -**)source with rapid adoption in the recent years.

## 2.1 Common uses

Python is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains, used extensively by internet service and high tech companies, and often used to teach computer science and programming.

## 2.2 Relative popularity

1. The following chart, produced using Stack Overflow Trends, shows one measure of the relative popularity of Python(**PI: .**)
2. Python is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide and a major tool for scientific computing, accounting for a rapidly rising share of scientific work through the globe.

## 2.3 Features

1. Python is a high-level language suitable for rapid development.
   - A high-level programming language is a programming language with **strong abstraction** from the details of the computer.
   - High vs Low: High may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems, making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than a lower-level language.
   - The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.
   
2. It has a relative small core language supported by many libraries.

3. It is a multi(**PI: -**)paradigm language.
   - Because multiple programming styles are supported.
   
4. It can be interpreted rather than compiled.
   - Interpretation vs. Compilation.
   
## 2.4 Syntax and Design

1. Elegant **syntax** matters.
   - Elegant code migth sound superfluousis(**PI: ,**) but in fact(**PI: ,**) it is highly beneficial because it makes the syntax easy to read and easy to remember.
   - This means we don't need to break down our reading flow in order to hunt down correct syntax.
   
2. Elegant **design** matters as well.
   - Features like iterators, generators, decorators, list comprehensions, etc. make Python highly expressive, allowing us to get more done with less code.
   - A namespace is a set of symbols that used to organize objects of various kinds so that all identifiers within it have unique names so that they can be easily identified.
   - [Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) improve producitivity by cutting down on bugs and syntax errors.
   


# 3 Scientific programming

## 3.1 Numerical programming

1. Fundamental matrix and array processing capabilities are provided by the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).
   - NumPy provides the basic array data type plus some simple processing operations.
2. The [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) library is built on top of NumPy and provides additional functionality.
   - SciPy includes many of the standard routines used in 
     - linear algebra
     - integration
     - interpolation (**?**)
     - optimization
     - distributions and random number generation
     - signal processing
     - etc.
   - The number we see above might vary slightly but it's essentially $0$.
     - For older versions of Python and NumPy(**PI: ,**) we need to use the `np.dot` function(**PI: .**)
3. The Scipy library is built on top of NumPy and provides additional functionality.
   - SciPy includes many of the standard routines used in
     - linear algebra
     - interpolation
     - optimizaton
     - distributions and random number generation
     - signal processing
     - etc.

```python
import numpy as np

# Build some arrays.

a = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 100)
b = np.cos(a)
c = np.sin(a)
```

```python
# inner product of b & c
b @ c
```

```python
from scipy.stats import norm
from scipy.integrate import quad

psi = norm()
value, error = quad(psi.pdf, -2, 2)
value
```

## 3.2 Graphics

1. The most popular and comprehensive Python library for creating figures and graphs is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
   - Plots, histograms, contour images, 3D, bar charts, etc.
   - Output in many formats (PDF, PNG, EPS, etc.)
   - LaTeX integration
   
2. Other graphics libraries include
   - [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)
   - [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
   - [VPython](http://www.vpython.org/) - 3D graphics and animations

## 3.3 Symbolic Algebra
1. [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/) library provides this functionality from within the Python shell, and we can
   - manipulate symbolic algebra,
   - solve polynomials, and 
   - calculate limits, derivatives and integrals.

2. The beauty of importing this functionality into Python is that we are working within a fully(**PI: -**)fledged programming language.
   - (**PI: We**) can easily create tables of derivatives, generate LaTeX output, add it to figures, etc.

```python
# symbolic expression

from sympy import Symbol

x, y = Symbol('x'), Symbol('y')  # we should treat 'x' and 'y' as algebraic symbols

x + x + x + x + x + x + y
```

```python
# Manipulate expressions

expression = (x + y)**2
expression.expand()
```

```python
# solve polynomials: niubility

from sympy import solve

solve(x**2 + x + 2)
```

```python
# calculate limits, derivatives and integrals

from sympy import limit, sin, diff

limit(1 / x, x, 0) # limit(expression, variable, limit target)
```

```python
limit(sin(x) / x, x, 0)
```

```python
# derivatives

diff(sin(x) ,x)
```

## 3.4 Statistics
There are many libraries for working with data.

### 3.4.1 Pandas
1. [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is fast, efficient, flexible and well-designed. 

```python
# pandas

import pandas as pd
np.random.seed(1234)

data = np.random.randn(5, 2) # create 5 by 2 matrix of N(0, 1) random draws
dates = pd.date_range('28/12/2010', periods=5)

df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=('price', 'weight'), index=dates)
print(df)
```

```python
df.mean()
```

### 3.4.2 Other useful statistic libraries

1. [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/) - various statistical routines
2. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) - machine learning in Python
3. [pyMC](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/) - for Bayesian data analysis
4. [pystan](https://pystan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Bayesian analysis based on stan

## 3.5 Networks and Graphs
1. Python has many libraries for studying graphs, and one well-known is [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/)
   - Standard graph algorithms for analyzing network structure, etc.
   - Plotting routines
   - etc.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
np.random.seed(1234)

# Generate a random graph with node color determined by shortest path length from a central node
p = dict((i, (np.random.uniform(0, 1), np.random.uniform(0,1)))
        for i in range(200)) # Create distributions
g = nx.random_geometric_graph(200, 0.12, pos=p)
pos = nx.get_node_attributes(g, 'pos')

# Find node nearest the center point (0.5, 0.5)
dists = [(x - 0.5)**2 + (y - 0.5)**2 for x, y in list(pos.values())]
ncenter = np.argmin(dists)

# Plot graph, coloring by path length from central node
p = nx.single_source_shortest_path_length(g, ncenter)
plt.figure()
nx.draw_networkx_edges(g, pos, alpha=0.4)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(g,
                      pos,
                      nodelist=list(p.keys()),
                      node_size=120, alpha=0.5,
                      node_color=list(p.values()),
                      cmap=plt.cm.jet_r)
plt.show()
# Is it a problem? Should we fix it up?
# If it is randomly generated, then 
# why these networks look the same every time we generate it
```
