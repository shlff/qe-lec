# 2.7 pandas


# 1 overview

1. Pandas is a package of fast, efficient **data analysis tools** for Python.
   - Its popularity has surged in recent years, coincident with the rise of fields, such as data science and machine learning.
   - Here's a popularity comparison over time against STATA, SAS, and dplyr courtesy (**PI1: a link?**) of Stack Overflow Trends (**PI2: a link?**).
2. Just as **NumPy** provides the **basic array data type plus core array operations**, pandas
   - defines **fundamental structures for working with data** and
   - endows them with **methods that facilitate operations**, such as
     - reading in data
     - adjusting indices
     - working with dates and time series
     - sorting, grouping, re-ordering and general data munging
     - dealing with missing values, etc.
3. More sophisticated statistical functionality is left to other packages, such as **statsmodels and scikit-learn**, which are built on top of pandas.
   - This lecture will provide a basic introduction to pandas.
   - Throughout the lecture, we will assume that the following imports have taken place.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

import requests
!pip install pandas-datareader
```

# 2 series

1. Two important data types defined by pandas are `Series` and `DataFrame`.
   - A `Series` can be thought of as a "column" of data, such as a collection of observations on a single variable.
     - e.g., see Program 1.
       - Here, we can imagine the indices `0, 1, 2, 3` as indexing four listed companies, and the values being daily returns on their shares.
     - Pandas `Series` are (**PI: is**) built on top of NumPy arrays and support many similar operations, see Programs 2-3.
     - But `Series` provide(**PI: s**) more than NumPy arrays.
       - Not only do they have some additional (statistically oriented) methods, see Program 4.
       - But their indices are more flexible, see Program 5.
     - Viewed in this way, `Series` are like fast, efficient Python dictionaries (with the restriction that the items in the dictionary all have the same type--in this case, floats).
       - In fact, we can use much of the same syntax as Python dictionaries, see Program 6.
   - A `DataFrame` is an object for storing related columns of data.

```python
# Program 1

s = pd.Series(np.random.randn(4), name='daily returns')
s
```

```python
# Program 2: scalar multiplication

s * 100
```

```python
# Program 3: absolute value function

np.abs(s)
```

```python
# Program 4

s.describe()
```

```python
# Program 5

s.index = ['AMZN', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG']
s
```

```python
# Program 6

s['AMZN']
```

```python
# Program 7

s['AMZN'] = 0
s
```

```python
# Program 7

'AAPL' in s
```

# 3 dataframes

1. While a `Series` is a single column of data, a `DataFrame` is several columns, one for each variable.
   - In essence, a `DataFrame` in pandas is analogous to a (high optimized) Excel spreadsheet.
     - It is a powerful tool for representing and analyzing data that are naturally organized into rows and columns.
       - Often with descriptive  indexes for individual rows and individual columns.
2. Let's look at an example that reads data from the CSV file `test_pwt.csv`.
   - Supposing we have this data saved as `test_pwt.csv` (**PI3: add ` `**) in the present working directory (type `%pwd` in Jupyter to see what it is), it can be read in as Program 1-2.
   - We can select particular rows using standard Python array slicing notation, see Program 3.
   - To select columns, we can pass a list containing the names of the desired columns represented as strings, see Program 4.
   - To select both rows and columns using integers, the `iloc` attribute should be used with the format `.iloc[row, columns`, see Program 5.
   - To select rows and columns using a mixture of integers and labels, the `loc` attribute can be used in a similar way, see Program 6.
3. Let's imagine that we're only interested in population and total GDP (`tcgdp`).
   - One way to strip the data frame `df` down to only these variable is to overwrite the dataframe using the selection method described above, see Program 7.
   - Here the index `0, 1, \dots, 7` is redundant because we can use the country names as an index.
     - To do this, we set the index to be the `country` variable in the dataframe, see Program 8.
   - Let's give the columns slightly better names, see Program 9.
   - Population is in thousands, let's revert to single units, see Program 10.
4. Next, we are going to add a column showing real GDP per capita, multiplying by $1,000,000$ as we go because total GDP is in millions, see Program 11.

5. One of the nice things about pandas `DataFrame` and `Series` objects is that they have methods for plotting and visualization that work through Matplotlib.
   - e.g., we can easily generate a bar plot of GDP per capita, see Program 12.
     - At the moment, the data frame is ordered alphabetically on the countries.
   - Let's change it to GDP per capita, see Program 13.
     - i.e., it is ordered descending by GDP per capita.
   - Plotting as before now yields Program 14.

```python
# Program 1
df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.lectures.code/raw/master/pandas/data/test_pwt.csv')
type(df)
```

```python
# Program 2

df
```

```python
# Program 3

df[2:5]
```

```python
# Program 4

df[['country', 'tcgdp']]
```

```python
# Program 5

df.iloc[2:5, 0:4]
```

```python
# Program 6

df.loc[df.index[2:5], ['country', 'tcgdp']]
```

```python
# Program 7

df = df[['country', 'POP', 'tcgdp']]
df
```

```python
# Program 8

df = df.set_index('country')
df
```

```python
# Program 9

df.columns = 'population', 'total GDP'
df
```

```python
# Program 10

df['population'] = df['population'] * 1e3
df
```

```python
# Program 11

df['GDP percap'] = df['total GDP'] * 1e6 /df['population']
df
```

```python
# Program 12

df['GDP percap'].plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()
```

```python
# Program 13

df = df.sort_values(by='GDP percap', ascending=False)
df
```

```python
# Program 14

df['GDP percap'].plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()
```

# 4 on-line data sources

1. Python makes it straightforward to query online databases programmatically.
   - An important database for economists is FRED.
     - A vast collection of time series data maintained by the St. Louis Fed.
   - e.g., suppose that we are interested in the unemployment rate.
     - Via FRED, the entire series for the US civilian unemployment rate can be downloaded directly by entering this URL into our browser.
       - `https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv`
       - This request returns a CSV file, which will be handled by our default application for this class of files.
       - Alternatively, we can access the CSV file from within a Python program, as what we did in Program 1 of section 3.
         - This can be done with a variety of methods (**PI4: e.g.?**)
         - We start with a relatively low-level method and then return to pandas.
     

## 4.1 accessing data with requests

1. One option is to use requests, a standard Python library for requesting data over the Internet.
   - To begin, try the code in Program 1 on our computer.
   - If there's no error message, then the call has succeeded.
   - If we do get an error, then there are two likely causes.
     - We are not connected to the Internet.
     - Our machine is accessing the Internet through a proxy server, and Python isn't aware of this.
       - If so, then we can either
         - switch to another machine, or
         - solve our proxy problem by reading the documentations.
2. Assuming that all is working, we can now proceed to use the `source` object returned by the call in Program 1, see Program 2-4.
3. We could now write some additional code to parse this text and store it as an array.
   - But this is unnecessary, since pandas' `read_csv` function can handle the task for us, see Program 5.
     - We use `parse_dates=True` so that pandas recognizes our dates columns, allowing for simple date filtering.
   - The data has been read into a pandas DataFrame called `data` that we can now manipulate in the usual way, see Program 6.
   - Note that pandas offers many **other file type alternatives**.(**PI5:?**)
   - Pandas has a widely variety of top-level methods that we can use to read, excel, json, parquet or plug straight into a database server. (**PI6:?**)
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
# Program 1: PI7
url = 'http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv'
r = requests.get(url)
```

```python
# Program 2

source = r.content.decode().split("\n")
source[0]
```

```python
# Program 3

source[1]
```

```python
# Program 4

source[2]
```

```python
# Program 5 PI8:

data = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
```

```python
# Program 6

type(data)
```

```python
# program 7: A useful method to get a quick look at a data frame

data.head()
```

```python
# Program 8: our output might differ slightly

pd.set_option('precision', 1)
data.describe()
```

```python
# Program 9: We can also plot the unemployment rate from 2006 to 2012

data['2006':'2012'].plot()
plt.show()
```

## 4.2 using pandas_datareader to access data

1. The maker of pandas has also authored a library called pandas_datareader (**PI9: attach a link?**) that gives programmatic access to many data sources straight from the Jupyter notebook.
   - While some sources require an access key, many of the most important (e.g., FRED, OECD, EUROSTAT and the World Bank (**PI10: attach a link?**)) are free to use.
   - For now(**PI: ,**) let's work through one example of downloading and plotting data: the World Bank.
     - The World Bank collects and organizes data on a huge range of indicators.
       - e.g., here's some data on government debt as a ratio to GDP.
         - Program 10 fetches the data for us and plots time series for the US and Australia.
   - The documentation provides more details on how to access various data sources.

```python
# Program 10
# PI11: an error exists: no module named this; solved by `!pip install pandas=datareader`
from pandas_datareader import wb 

govt_debt = wb.download(indicator='GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS', country=['US', 'AU'], start=2005, end=2016).stack().unstack(0)
ind = govt_debt.index.droplevel(-1)
govt_debt.index = ind

ax = govt_debt.plot(lw=2)
plt.title("Government Debt to GDP (%)")
plt.show()
```
